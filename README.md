# Chatter-Box
My attempt at making a simple chat bot that can ammuse you with its witty jokes and facts. It can also answer some basic conversational questions.

This chat bot namely "Chatter Box" uses some interesting python libraries like chatterbot, dadjokes and randfacts. 
The chat bot app uses Flask to deploy the chatbot on the webpage. 
The chatterbot library helps to train the chatbot with some training converstional data, and dadjokes and randfacts libraries help the chat bot
to give new random facts and jokes when requested on the web page.

The web page uses some simple CSS and JS to make the chat bot lively along with the chatbot.py running in the background.
To run the chatter bot app run the "app.py" after cloning the folder. You can also include more training conversation data in the normal.txt file.
